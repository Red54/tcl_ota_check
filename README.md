TCL OTA Check
=============

This is a Python script originally created by [thurask](https://gist.github.com/thurask) ([original
GIST](https://gist.github.com/thurask/f4ace564e6575ef41c4e35d2458ca2d0)) to check for update files
for a BlackBerry KEYone phone. It tries to emulate the requests done by the "Updater" app or the
"Mobile Q Loader" firmware updater.
